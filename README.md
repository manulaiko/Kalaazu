Kalaazu
=======
*The next generation in DarkOrbit private servers.*

We all know that DarkOrbit sucks, we all know DarkOrbit Private Servers sucks more, now you have the possibility to make
a private server that doesn't sucks that much.

Kalaazu is a free, open source private server designed completely from 0 and developed by the community.
It aims to achieve a complete and clean solution to all the shitty private servers that are available right now, and
free.

Development
-----------

The development takes place right here, right now. For this reason there are some channels you need to know about.

* *info* contains the information about the current and overall state of the server.
* *changelog* contains the latest commits to the repo.
* *development* is where the dev. talk takes place.

The code is hosted in github: https://github.com/manulaiko/Kalaazu and the commits are pushed as the work takes place in
*development*, if you want to propose something, discuss it there before making a pull request.

The github repo will be used to host the code and as bug tracker.
The issues should be concise and explanatories, the discussion about them belongs to *development* so any reply to the
issue that isn't in *development* is going to be ignored.

Planning
--------

The development process is going to be hard and will take a lot of time. It will start with the architectural design
where we will discuss everything related to the software (platform, language, database, design, features, standards...).
Once the design is done, we will proceed to write the actual code and test it.

After the code has been done and tested, we could try to host it in a VPS so it can be playable, but that's not the
objective of Kalaazu, the main objective is to provide the community with a reliable and open source private server.

We have to design a solid architecture that will become the fundamental part of the private server.
